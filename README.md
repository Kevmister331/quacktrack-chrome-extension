# quacktrack-chrome-extension

QuackTrack - our BizTech HelloHacks 2022 hackathon project designed by Felix Ma, Kevin Hu, Nathan Lee, Steven Huang.

Our idea is centered around a Google chrome extension that that monitors how much time you spend on each website and tracks your screentime.

The front end is in the popup.html and style.css files. 
The back end is in the main.py, maintests.py, and popup.js files.
